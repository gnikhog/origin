When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  Remote repositories are great when working from multiple computers as well as
  working as part of a group. Remote repositories expand accessibility at the
  expense of having to use a network to acccess THE remote location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Automatic pull could overwrite or otherwise interfer with your work should
  someone else be working on the same file and issuing commits.  Manual pulls
  ensure that you only update your file(s) when you are ready.
