When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  Remote repositories are great when working from multiple computers as well as
  working as part of a group. Remote repositories expand accessibility at the
  expense of having to use a network to acccess THE remote location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Automatic pull could overwrite or otherwise interfer with your work should
  someone else be working on the same file and issuing commits.  Manual pulls
  ensure that you only update your file(s) when you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  Branches occur only within a given repository and are used to explore or to
  develop changes in the code or to otherwise label a give code version.
  Clones are copies of repositories that can be locally or remotely located.
  These are used to make copies of entire repositories.  Forks are essentially
  clones of repositories but retain links to the original repsository and is
  completely created while on the GitHub website.
